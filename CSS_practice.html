        <p class="paragraph">Dogs are eager students from the time that they’re very young (some breeders even begin
            basic training with
            pups as young as five weeks old), so it’s never too early to begin training.

            You can start your puppy off on the right paw by teaching good manners from the moment you bring him home.
            Every interaction that you have with your puppy is a learning opportunity, and with gentle guidance, you can
            help him understand important lessons like how to greet new friends without jumping up, how to wait quietly
            for dinner and what to do with those puppy teeth.

        <p>Interacting with your dog in a way that seamlessly weaves manners into his everyday life sets the stage for
            future training. Plus it’s easier to add positive behaviors to your puppy’s repertoire than it is to
            “un-train” negative ones.</p>
